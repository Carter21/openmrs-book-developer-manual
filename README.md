# Welcome to OpenMRS!

Thank you for your interest in the OpenMRS Community! We have created this book for people who are curious about becoming a developer using our software. This book serves as a quick guide for you to learn more about our history, what [OpenMRS does,](http://openmrs.org/about/mission/) and understand more about how our community works.

If you find yourself eager to get started, we've also included some practical advice on specific steps you can take right away to start doing development with the OpenMRS platform.

As with much of free and open source software, what you're reading is a **"living" and evolving resource!** This book was initially created over just 3 days during the 2013 [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) Doc Sprints held at the Google campus in Mountain View, California, United States.

The event was a partnership between the Google Open Source Programs Office, Aspiration, and FLOSS Manuals. The initial authors of this book represented a wide variety of OpenMRS community members & developers:

* **Michael Downey**  (United States)
* **Eric Holscher** (United States)
* **Suranga Nath Kasthurirathne** (Sri Lanka)
* **Daniel Kayiwa** (Uganda)
* **Jordan Kellerstrass** (United States)
* **Elyse Voegeli** (United States)
